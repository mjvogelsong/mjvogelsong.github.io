Hi!
I'm Michael, and I like pushing AI research and making it practical.

I'm currently chief ML engineer at [Groundlight](https://www.groundlight.ai/), a computer vision startup in Seattle.
Before that, I spent about 6 years building deep learning into a bunch of different applications at Amazon -- things like scalable nearest neighbor search over vector embeddings and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for data-efficient fulfillment center robotics.
I also did some work with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center to develop ML methods for optimizing personalized cancer vaccines.
