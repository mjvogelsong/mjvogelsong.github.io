Hi!
I'm Michael, and I like pushing AI research forward and making it practical.
I'm currently head of foundation models AI at [Cobot](https://www.co.bot/), working in Seattle, WA.

Previously, I was chief ML engineer at [Groundlight AI](https://www.groundlight.ai/).
Before that, I researched and built deep learning into a bunch of different applications at Amazon -- things like scalable nearest neighbor search over vector embeddings and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for data-efficient fulfillment center robotics.
I also started a project with Fred Hutch Cancer Center to develop ML methods for optimizing personalized cancer vaccines.
