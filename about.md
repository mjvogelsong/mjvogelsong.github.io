Hi!
My name is Michael, and I like pushing the frontier of AI research and making it practical.
I'm currently head of foundation models AI at [Collaborative Robotics (Cobot)](https://co.bot).

Previously, I was chief ML engineer at [Groundlight AI](https://www.groundlight.ai/).
Before that, I researched and built deep learning into a bunch of different applications at Amazon -- things like scalable nearest neighbor search over vector embeddings and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for data-efficient fulfillment center robotics.
I also started a project with Fred Hutch Cancer Center to develop ML methods for optimizing personalized cancer vaccines.

In general, I'm fascinated by learning -- how people learn, how computers learn, how groups learn.
