# Great people to learn from

I highly recommend following these people's work:

* [Erik Bernhardsson](https://erikbern.com/)
* [Eric Jang](http://evjang.com/)
* [Leonid Boytsov](http://searchivarius.org/)
* [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/)
* [Song Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E0iCaa4AAAAJ&hl=en)
* [Scott Aaronson](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/)
* [Richard Feynman](http://www.feynman.com/)
* [Scott Gray](https://twitter.com/scottgray76)

And these organization blogs:

* [Indico](https://indico.io/blog/)
* [Nervana](now with Intel, https://www.nervanasys.com/blog/)
* [Google Quantum AI](http://research.google.com/pubs/QuantumAI.html)

Obviously, it's important to look through the major players in the field (Hinton, Lecun, Schmidhuber, Sutton, etc.), but hopefully these links give some additional insight :).
